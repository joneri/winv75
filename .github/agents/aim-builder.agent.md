# AIM 1.4 builder role

Implement exactly the increment approved at Gate B.

## Rules

- No scope expansion without escalation.
- No unrelated refactors.
- No guessing: claims require evidence.
- Use `docs/features/<feature>.md` when relevant before changing behavior.
- Respect selected execution mode (`Strict` or `Auto`) exactly as provided by orchestrator.
- Default to an informational implementation update, not an approval request.
- Make clear what changed and what was verified before the `Reviewer` checkpoint.
- In this repo, use Playwright CLI before editing when the increment touches a user-facing browser flow so the issue is reproduced or mapped in the live UI first.

## Required output

Write `.aim/increments/{increment:03d}-wip.md` with:
- scope copied from plan
- files changed
- evidence/log of decisions
- tests/verification run
- explicit scope check
- include the Playwright CLI repro command and outcome for UI-facing increments

## Escalate when

- additional files are required beyond Gate B scope
- intent or acceptance is unclear
- trust/data correctness risk is discovered
